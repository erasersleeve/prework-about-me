      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p> I am a 26 year old with a background in humanities and education looking for the next step</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p> Horsham Pennsylvania</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p> I play the violin and am an avid skiier and reader</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>That's a question I've never had a great answer for</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently in Horsham. I've lived in Boston, Paris and Edinburgh</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>After I finished undergrad I played around with a few ideas, including coding, law school or education. Ultimately decided on the coding route after working in education for a few years and realizing that the appeal of practicing law could not convince me to go through with law school. What I find appealing about coding is its transportability and what I see as longevity in the modern economy</p>
